Design, build, and prototype voice AI agents on AWS. A guided studio for configuring real-time speech agents — from industry template to live phone call — powered by Amazon Nova Sonic, Strands Agents BidiAgent, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

> **Sample / proof-of-concept.** This project is a reference implementation for learning and prototyping. Review and harden it (security, error handling, scaling, cost controls) before using it for production workloads.

## The Voice Agent Stack

A real-time voice agent isn't a single model — it's a stack of decisions. Each layer is chosen independently, and the trade-offs at one layer ripple into the others:

* **Model** — what hears, thinks, and speaks (speech-to-speech like Nova Sonic, or STT + LLM + TTS).
* **Framework** — what orchestrates the session: streaming, turn detection, and tool calls (Strands BidiAgent, LiveKit, Pipecat).
* **Integrations** — what the agent can actually do (knowledge bases/RAG, APIs, MCP, other agents).
* **Channel** — how callers reach it: the protocol and transport (WebSocket, WebRTC, PSTN, SIP).
* **Hosting** — where it runs and how it scales (managed runtimes, containers, on-prem).

This studio turns those layers into a guided workflow: you pick a model and voice, wire up tools and RAG, choose a channel (browser, PSTN, or SIP), and deploy to a managed runtime on AWS — without hand-assembling the stack yourself. The current build uses Amazon Nova 2 Sonic (speech-to-speech) on the Strands BidiAgent framework, hosted on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

---

## Architecture

The solution has four deployable components. The core app is deployed by the CDK (`deployment/deploy.sh`); the two telephony paths are deployed independently because they provision internet-facing network infrastructure subject to a higher security review bar.

| Component | How it's deployed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Frontend app** (React UI + demos/tools/RAG API, Cognito) | CDK — `deploy.sh` |
| **2. Voice agent on AgentCore** (Nova Sonic BidiAgent runtime) | CDK — `deploy.sh` |
| **3. PSTN relay** (Twilio TAC bridge) | Independent — `telephony/pstn/` |
| **4. SIP relay** (drachtio + bridge) | Independent — `telephony/sip/` |

---

## Features

### Agent Builder

* Cognito auth with SigV4 presigned WebSocket URLs
* Multi-tenant — each user sees only their own agents, tools, and evals (admins see all)
* One-command CDK deployment to AWS

---

## Deployment

The core app (frontend + voice agent on AgentCore) is deployed with CDK via `deployment/deploy.sh`. Prerequisites, supported regions, CDK stacks, IAM permissions, environment variables, and step-by-step instructions live in the deployment guide:

* `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — full deployment guide
* `docs/LOCAL-DEVELOPMENT.md` — running locally without a full deploy

The two telephony paths (PSTN and SIP) are optional and deployed separately — see `telephony/pstn/` and `telephony/sip/`.

---

## Telephony

Real-world voice agents need phone connectivity. The studio provides two telephony paths, letting you test agents over actual phone calls during development, with a direct SIP integration path for enterprise-style deployments.

*Deployed separately from the main CDK app.* Both telephony paths provision internet-facing network infrastructure (public load balancers, open UDP ports) that is subject to a higher security review bar than the rest of the solution. Their source and self-managed deployment instructions live under the top-level `telephony/` folder (`telephony/pstn/` and `telephony/sip/`) — they are not created by `deploy.sh`.

### PSTN (Twilio Conversation Relay)
Callers dial a Twilio number and talk to the same voice agent that runs in the browser. Multiple agents can share one phone number with DTMF menu selection.
* **Infrastructure:** ECS Fargate + ALB + CloudFront (HTTPS/WSS only)
* **Network:** Public-only VPC (no private subnets, no NAT Gateway) — Fargate tasks get public IPs directly
* **Media:** Twilio handles all RTP/codec; bridge receives audio as base64 WebSocket messages
* **Security boundary:** CloudFront TLS termination, no open UDP ports

### SIP (Direct Trunk)
Direct SIP integration for enterprise contact centers (Genesys, Five9, NICE) or Twilio SIP Trunking. Lower latency with direct RTP media handling.
* **Infrastructure:** EKS Managed Node Group + NLB (UDP)
* **Network:** Nodes in public subnet with `hostNetwork` — RTP requires direct public IP addressability (NAT Gateway cannot forward inbound UDP)
* **Media:** Self-managed RTP — bridge receives raw UDP packets, converts $\mu$-law 8kHz $\leftrightarrow$ PCM 16kHz
* **Security boundary:** Security group (restrict to provider IPs in production), SIP TLS + SRTP recommended

### Why Different Network Designs

| Feature | PSTN Relay | SIP Relay |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VPC** | Public subnets only, no NAT | Public + private subnets, NAT for EKS control plane ENIs |
| **Inbound protocol** | HTTPS/WSS (Twilio manages RTP) | Raw UDP 5060 + 20000-20100 |
| **Compute** | Fargate (no host access needed) | EKS with `hostNetwork` (must bind UDP ports on host IP) |
| **Load balancer** | ALB (HTTP/WebSocket) | NLB (UDP) |
| **Public IP exposure** | Only via CloudFront | Node's public IP in SDP (directly addressable) |

## Speech Pipelines

### Bidirectional Streaming (Speech-to-Speech)
The implemented pipeline. A single model handles speech input, reasoning, and speech output in one stream. Lowest latency — audio goes in, audio comes out, no intermediate text step required.

The agent runtime (`source/agent/main.py`) builds a Strands BidiAgent with the selected speech-to-speech model, which manages bidirectional WebSocket streaming, tool orchestration, and turn detection.

Three providers are supported (chosen in the wizard):

| Provider | Model | API key | Audio rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Amazon Nova 2 Sonic** | `amazon.nova-2-sonic-v1:0` | Not needed (uses the AgentCore role) | 16 kHz |
| **OpenAI Realtime** | `gpt-realtime` | Required (entered in the wizard) | 24 kHz |
| **Google Gemini Live** | `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025` | Required (entered in the wizard) | 24 kHz |

The runtime selects the model via `create_model()` (in `main.py` / `strands_agent.py`) and reports the model's audio sample rate to the client in the session-ready message, so the browser plays and captures audio at the right rate. Provider model IDs are overridable via the `OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL_ID` / `GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL_ID` env vars.

> **Note:** If you select OpenAI or Gemini without providing that provider's API key, the session fails with a clear error (no silent fallback to Nova Sonic). The telephony bridges (PSTN/SIP) currently assume 16 kHz audio, so OpenAI/Gemini over a phone call would need the bridge sample rates updated first — browser testing supports all three today.

Cascaded pipeline (STT $\rightarrow$ LLM $\rightarrow$ TTS) is not implemented. The wizard contains disabled UI scaffolding for a cascaded workflow (a hidden `CascadedSpeech` page and unused `pipeline: 'cascaded'` / `framework: 'pipecat' | 'livekit'` type options), but there is no backend for it — the agent runtime only creates a Nova Sonic BidiAgent, and no STT/LLM/TTS or Pipecat/LiveKit code or dependencies exist in the source. Speech-to-Speech is the only working pipeline.

---

## Agent Tools

* **Reserved:** `endCallTool` (end the call gracefully) and `transferCall` (transfer to a live agent/department) — always available to every agent. All other tools (knowledge base, CRM, calendar, etc.) are configured as custom tools via the Tools UI, not pre-built.
* **Integrations:** Webhooks (HTTP), Lambda functions, MCP gateways (AgentCore), sub-agents
* **Custom:** Define tools in the UI with name, description, parameters, and mock response — dynamically created at session start.
* **RAG:** Upload documents to a Bedrock Knowledge Base and query them as a tool during conversations.

---

## Evaluation

Test voice agents before they reach production. The studio runs an agent against a simulated caller and scores the resulting conversation, so you can compare prompts and models and catch regressions.

### Eval Suites
An eval suite groups reusable test cases for an agent. Each test case captures a base prompt, target model, and a set of simulated-caller scenarios, so the same checks can be re-run as the agent evolves. Suites are per-user (admins can see all), and every run is stored for later comparison.

### Real vs Mock Tools
Each run chooses how the agent's tools behave:
* **Live** — the agent calls the real integration (HTTP webhook, Lambda, AgentCore MCP gateway, or sub-agent). Tools with no real integration fall back to their mock response.
* **Mock** — every tool returns its configured dummy response, so you can exercise conversation logic without hitting external systems.

### LLM-as-Judge Scoring
After the simulated conversation completes, an LLM judge evaluates the transcript against configurable evaluation aspects and rubrics, producing per-metric PASS/FAIL verdicts with reasoning, an overall pass rate, and strengths/weaknesses. Runs execute asynchronously and report `PENDING` $\rightarrow$ `RUNNING` $\rightarrow$ `EVALUATING` $\rightarrow$ `COMPLETED`.

### Performance Metrics
Every run captures voice-latency metrics from the AgentCore session, aggregated as min / max / avg / p50 / p95:
* **TTFT** — Time to first token (user input end $\rightarrow$ first text from the agent)
* **TTFB** — Time to first byte (user input end $\rightarrow$ first audio byte from the agent)
* **Tool execution** — Time from tool call to tool result

Additional per-turn measurements (turn-taking gap, tool-to-speech, total tool time) are recorded in the interaction log.

*Backend:* `source/api/eval_handler.py` and `eval_suites_handler.py` (API), `source/eval-runner/` (async runner + AgentCore adapter).  
*UI:* The Eval Suites pages under `source/frontend/src/pages/`.
